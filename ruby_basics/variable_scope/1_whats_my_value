# 7 is logged to screen.
# the value of 'a' (10) is the parameter and not the variable it self.
# 'b' is a new object and has not relation to var 'a'. 
# Methods have a 'self-contained' scope. If you were to
# try to mutate 'a' from inside the method you would 
# get an error saying 'a' does not exist.
# scope wise nothing inside method can affect anything
# outside, nor can anything outside affect anything inside# the method.
