 1.  Without looking anything up I originally thought there was a 
  possibility that you could not '[]' a string and an error
  would return.
 2. I thought similarly to the previous exercises that
  'a' would not be changed at all.

I was wrong. Strings are apparently mutable, but only 
  with certain methods. #[] being one. 

I tried
  b.downcase!
  and
  b.replace('blue') (destructive method)
but neither worked. 
so I am assuming only certain methods are able to mutate
it.
